# Interview Alejandro Perea: iOS/Swift exercise

The goal of this exercise is to analyze the candidate's:
- Organization of code and skills in Swift 5
- Knowlege of connection with an API Rest
- Implementation with 3rd party libraries


Do a small iOS App in Swift that allows: 
To compress a PDF using the API Rest of https://developer.ilovepdf.com/docs/api-reference (Create a free developer account)
- The PDF is not needed to be selected by the user, it can be done only by clicking a button 'Compress'
- Download the output PDF file and open it with a PDF library of your choice (for instance: PDFKit https://developer.apple.com/documentation/pdfkit)
- Push source code in this repository, no need to create different branches
- Edit this README or create a new one with instructions on how to install the App 

Extra points:
- Let the user choose the file to compress from the files in the device
- Let the user choose the level of compression before sendind the PDF to compress to the API Rest


Timing:
- Deliver before 16/02/2022, but early delivers will be valued positively


Notes:
- Ask us any doubt regarding the API
- After the interview, none of the code will be used by ILOVEPDF and will be destroyed if the candidate is not hired.


Instructions:

- Simple installation on the device or simulator, save the PDFs locally on the device, select the one you want to compress, select the compression level and at the end of the process, the compressed PDF will be displayed on a new screen.
- To use other public keys, go to the path PDFTest/Credentials/Credentials.plist, modify the public_key field.

- enjoy :)
